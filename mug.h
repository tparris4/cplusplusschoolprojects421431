/*pseudo-code for mug.h
File: Mug.h
Class Provided: A class that simulates a no longer magic mug, Suddenly we have
a Hard capacity. Still only non-alcoholic drinks though.
By the end of this lab we will also be able to
print out the mug contents (using cout) and add contents of one mug to another mug, or instantiate another mug to the same amount by initializing it with a given amount.
Finally we will be able to cin into a mug and

Constructors for the mug class:
(mug()
Postcondition: amountFilled=0.0)--> this is now covered by our default argument in the mug(double initialFill) constructor

mug(double initialFill)
Precondition: initialFill>=0.0
Postcondition: amountFilled equals initialFill

Modification Member Functions
void fillMug(double amount)
Precondition: amount>=0.0
Postcondition: amountFilled is now increased by amount

void empty()
Postcondition: the cup is emptied

Constant Member Functions
double getFillAmount() const
Postcondition: The value returned is the amount the mug is currently filled to

bool isEmpty() const
Postcondition: returns true if the mug is empty, and false if it's not.

NONMEMBER FUNCTIONS
istream& operator >>(istream& ins, mug& target)
Postcondition: The amountFilled of target has been written from ins.The return value is the istream ins.

ostream& operator <<(ostream& outs, const mug& source)
Postcondition: The amountFilled of source has been written to outs
The return value is the outstream outs.
